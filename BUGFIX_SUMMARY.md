# AGS v1.5.0 Critical Bug Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the critical bug fixes implemented to address production issues found in ground stations during June-July 2025.

## Issues Addressed

Based on production data from multiple ground stations, the following critical issues were identified and fixed:

1. **EAI_AGAIN DNS Resolution Failures** - Multiple stations (AGS 11, 14, 2) experiencing DNS resolution failures
2. **"Updating Passes" Freeze** - Stations getting stuck during satellite pass calculation (AGS 14, 2, 23)
3. **Network Initialization Failures** - Boot failures due to network interface detection issues (AGS 11, 18)
4. **Upload Failures** - EAI_AGAIN errors during file uploads (AGS 21)

## Files Modified

### Core System Files
- `tle.js` - Enhanced TLE data processing with timeout protection and cache fallback
- `network.js` - Improved network initialization with comprehensive timeout handling
- `scheduler.js` - Added timeout protection for pass updates and intelligent error recovery
- `upload.js` - Enhanced upload reliability with better error handling and retry logic

### New Files
- `diagnose.js` - Diagnostic tool to identify common production issues
- Added script to `package.json` for easy diagnostics

### Documentation
- `plan.md` - Updated with comprehensive troubleshooting guide and bug fix documentation

## Key Improvements

### 1. Timeout Protection
- **TLE Processing:** 2-minute overall timeout, 30-second per-satellite timeout
- **Network Init:** 90-second overall timeout with individual operation timeouts
- **Pass Updates:** 3-minute timeout protection
- **Uploads:** 60-second timeout with enhanced retry logic

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Network Errors:** Comprehensive detection of DNS and connectivity issues
- **Graceful Degradation:** System continues with cached data when network fails
- **Intelligent Recovery:** Automatic restart logic based on error type
- **Better Feedback:** Clear LCD messages for different error conditions

### 3. Robustness Features
- **Cache Fallback:** Automatic use of cached TLE data when network unavailable
- **Error Classification:** Differentiate network, configuration, and system errors
- **Progressive Delays:** Escalating retry delays for persistent network issues
- **Validation:** Enhanced data validation throughout the system

### 4. Diagnostic Capabilities
- **Diagnostic Tool:** `npm run diagnose` to check system health
- **Enhanced Logging:** More detailed error messages and troubleshooting info
- **Status Reporting:** Clear indication of system state and issues

## Production Impact

These fixes directly address the specific error patterns observed in production:

- **AGS 11 (Scotland):** DNS resolution and network initialization issues
- **AGS 17 (New York):** System freezing and hardware issues
- **AGS 18 (Seattle):** Boot failures and configuration problems
- **AGS 14 (Chile):** "Updating passes" freeze and reboot issues
- **AGS 2 (Cornwall):** Network-related failures and short recordings
- **AGS 21:** Upload failures with EAI_AGAIN errors

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Network Failure Testing:** Disconnect network during startup
2. **DNS Resolution Testing:** Block DNS to test EAI_AGAIN handling
3. **Timeout Testing:** Simulate slow network conditions
4. **Configuration Testing:** Test invalid WiFi credentials
5. **Recovery Testing:** Verify automatic restart behavior

## Deployment

This version (1.5.0) should be deployed to all production ground stations experiencing the documented issues. The enhanced error handling and timeout protection should prevent systems from getting stuck in unrecoverable states.

## Diagnostic Usage

Ground station operators can now run diagnostics:

```bash
npm run diagnose
```

This will check for common issues and provide specific guidance for resolution.

## Version History

- **v1.4.0:** Previous stable version with logger resilience and LCD improvements
- **v1.5.0:** Critical bug fixes for production DNS, timeout, and network issues

The fixes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving system reliability and error recovery capabilities.
